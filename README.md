# Quora-duplicate-questions
Internet is a place to share and gain knowledge. It allows
people to learn from each other and understand the world
better. But, a lot of websites have multiple type of question
with the same answer. Having such questions can make
seekers spend more time finding the best answer for their
question, and make writers spend more time in answering
multiple versions of the same questions. The goal of our
project is to predict from a pair of questions, if the questions
have the same meaning.
Detecting similarity in sentences has many
applications in natural language understanding, ranging from
paraphrase identification to evaluating machine translation. In
this paper we focus on detecting the duplicate questions, a
problem prevalent in online Q&A forums like Quora, Reddit
and Stack Overflow.
We perform numerous experiments using Quora’s
“Question Pairs” dataset, which consists of 404,288 pairs of
questions labeled as ‘duplicates’ or ‘not duplicates’. We
assume that questions marked as duplicates in the Quora
dataset are semantically equivalent (duplicate)
